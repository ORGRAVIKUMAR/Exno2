        <h1 style="font-size:300%;text-align:center"> MUSIC COMPOSER </h1>
        <p style=";text-align:left;font-size: 20px;"> Musical composition can refer to an original piece or work of music,either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score," which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 20px;"> Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies. </p>
